Born 1978 in the UK, Lindsey is an artist and scientist and member of ParTerre
6 studio in  Innsbruck. Her artistic work explores the  boundaries of scientific
and artistic inquiry/understanding and how they can generate meaning  in
society - always revelling in the personal process, but never yet happy with
the product.  Her scientific research on glaciers focuses on connecting
innovative field  measurements with mathematical modelling of systems. She
has a BSc in Geography,a PhD in Glaciology and an MA in  Applied Art.
