Glaciers are often portrayed as icons of global warming because of their
physical loss through melting and the loss of climate records stored in glacial
ice. If we take a step back from what they have become symbols for, what can we
unlearn and learn from being with a glacier? In these works I explored capturing
the body of Suldenferner - a glacier in Stelvio National Park - using natural
carbon inks and cyanotype as part of our collective effort to develop a 
hickening Description for Thinning Ice. 

Part of the group exhibition
[‘This is not a glacier’](https://ail.angewandte.at/program/this-is-not-a-glacier-exhibition),
which, along with a related symposium and accompanying zine formed the research
presentation stemming from an excursion to a glacier.
