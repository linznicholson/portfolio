“Even while in constant motion, water is also a planetary archive of meaning and
matter” states Astrida Neimanis in Hydrofeminism: Or, On Becoming a Body of
Water. The glacier, in its frigid state of being, is a living archive of our
climate history. Snowfall of the last hundreds, thousands and in some cases tens
of thousands of years are layered, and by pressure, melt and motion, eventually
amalgamate. The ice holds a comprehensive memory of all the experiences of the
glacier that brought it to its current icy body, over its long and varied
lifetime. A glacier is like an almanac: reading it reveals its cold, climatic
rhythms.
