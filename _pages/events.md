**2023 Speaker**: Alternate Glacialities, Graz<br>Workshop presentation (45 minutes) <br>
Nature is replete with cycles, and glaciers, which have waxed and waned over
geological time in  response to changes in Earth’s energy receipts, are no
exception. Yet these cycles are non symmetrical; glacier decline does not mirror
glacier growth in pacing or process, and the glaciers  alter their own landscape
over time, giving rise to a hysteresis rather than a reversible oscillation.
Using these examples of glacier change we explore irreversible aspects of natural
systems, and  how these affect our sense of agency in the face of climate crisis.
<br>Part of an artistic/scientific/philosophical exchange workshop on Mapping the
Irreverse, to explore  the quantum and macro scale conceptions and implications
of irreversibility. <a href="https://www.the-irreverse.zone/">https://www.the-irreverse.zone/</a>
