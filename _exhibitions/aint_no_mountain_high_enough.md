title: "Ain’t no mountain high enough"
year: 2024
---

When we think of a mountain, whether literally or figuratively, our feelings
are stirred: strength, fragility, respect, fear, eternity, silence, power,
summit, miracle, excitement, curiosity, success, nature, movement, anxiety,
liberation, challenge, stability, cold, warmth, majesty, existence, universe,
climate change, growth, humility, ascent, descent, magnificence, horizons,
solitude, connection etc. As an exploration of resilience and connection we
worked with Girls on Ice Austria to produce “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” - a
profound metaphor for the human spirit’s capacity to overcome obstacles with
the strong essence of resilience.
