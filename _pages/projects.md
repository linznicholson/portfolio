I am an artist and scientist hailing from Scotland but based in Innsbruck. My artistic work explores the  boundaries of scientific and artistic inquiry/understanding and how they can generate meaning  in society -  Iâ€™m always revelling in the personal process, but never yet happy with the product.  My scientific research on glaciers focuses on connecting innovative field  measurements with mathematical modelling of systems. I have a BSc in Geography, a PhD in Glaciology and an MA in  Applied Art, and am a member of ParreTerre_6 studio in Innsbruck.

Here a list of my projects:
