Interesting things occur in the space between multiple realities represented by
ideas,  concepts, and different ways of knowing or being. The ancient practice
of making  string figures, chosen and made collectively during the exhibition,
fills the spaces of the  structure with stories and symbols representing the
worlds of meaning that exist in this  inbetween space. 

Part of the group exhibition
[From there through here](https://www.k-haus.at/besuch/kalender/ausstellung/408/from-there-through-here.html),
related to the FWF PEEK funded project
[Radical Matter](https://www.radicalmatter.art/about) between Royal College of
Arts, London and the University of Applied Art, Vienna.
